## Summary
Reincarnation is designed as a decompiler intended to support modern Java syntax.
Eventually, it should be able to understand all of the syntax and grammars listed below.
However, some information that is completely removed by the compiler and cannot be accessed from the bytecode cannot be restored,
but we believe that the restored code will not interfere with its operation.

The output method of the analyzed code is not limited to Java, but is designed to be convertible to a variety of languages.

The overwhelming majority of changes to this project don't add new features at all. Optimizations, tests, documentation, refactorings -- these are all part of making this product meet the highest standards of code quality and usability.
Contributing improvements in these areas is much easier, and much less of a hassle, than contributing code for new features.

### Bug Reports
